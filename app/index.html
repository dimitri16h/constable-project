	<p>Deadpool is running for Fayette-County Constable. You may remember him from his preidential campaign in 2016. Since the defeat, he has lowered his sights and is looking to take any elected office he can win. We need your help to make this happen!</p>

	<p>We believe Deadpool's values align with those of every demographic on a fundamental level. Because we are in politics, Deadpool also uses a lot of political jargon on the campaign. So you know he is for you!</p>
